# Universal Request Handler

When receiving a user request, follow this process:

## Step 1: Classify the Task

Identify which of the 4 categories the request belongs to:

| Icon | Type        | Keywords to Detect |
|:----:|:------------|:-------------------|
| 🔍 | **CONSULT** | "should", "recommend", "compare", "suggest", "advice" |
| 🏗️ | **BUILD**   | "create", "make", "build", "add", "implement", "write" |
| 🔧 | **DEBUG**   | "error", "bug", "not working", "wrong", "fix" |
| ⚡ | **OPTIMIZE** | "slow", "refactor", "clean", "improve", "optimize" |

> **Note:** If unclear → Ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 2: Execute Based on Mode

### 🔍 CONSULT Mode

1.  Clarify context & constraints (OS, Hardware, Language).
2.  Provide 2-3 options with clear trade-offs.
3.  Recommend the optimal option with reasoning.
4.  **WAIT for confirmation** before coding.

### 🏗️ BUILD Mode

1.  Confirm scope & acceptance criteria.
2.  Propose structure (File/Class/Node hierarchy).
3.  Implementation Order:
    *   **Interfaces/Contracts** (Header files / MSGs / Types)
    *   **Core Logic** (Algorithms / Business Logic)
    *   **Integration** (Wiring / Launch files / Main loop)
4.  Run checklist before delivery.

### 🔧 DEBUG Mode

1.  Gather info: **What** (Error), **Where** (Log/Stack trace), **When** (Steps).
2.  Analyze root cause (Hardware vs Software?).
3.  Propose fix + explanation.
4.  Suggest prevention measures.

### ⚡ OPTIMIZE Mode

1.  Measure baseline (Latency, Memory, CPU, Build Size).
2.  Identify main bottlenecks.
3.  Propose improvements + predict results.
4.  Refactor + compare before/after.

## Step 3: Pre-Delivery Checklist

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] **Type Safety:** No implicit types / void* abuse / unchecked casts.
- [ ] **Constants:** No hardcoded magic numbers/strings.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Proper exceptions / Result types / Return codes.
- [ ] **Naming:** Clear variable/function naming (English).

**Structure:**
- [ ] Correct folder structure.
- [ ] Consistent naming convention.
- [ ] Split files appropriately (SRP).

**System/Performance:**
- [ ] Resource cleanup (Desctructors / Dispose / Close).
- [ ] Event Loop / Real-time constraints respected.
- [ ] No Memory Leaks.

## Tips

- ❌ Don't expand scope unilaterally.
- ❌ Don't use unsafe patterns (e.g. `system("rm -rf")`).
- ✅ Ask when requirements are unclear.
- ✅ Comment complex logic.
- ✅ Prioritize: Reliability → Readability → Performance.
